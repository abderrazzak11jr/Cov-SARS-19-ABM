covid sars 19 agent-based-model
## SUMMARY
The Covid Sars 19 dispersion model belong to classical pandemic dispesion agent-based model, demonstrating how even a mild infected fraction of agents can lead to a much higher numbers of infected peoples in case of lack of controlling procedures . The model consists of agents on a square grid, where each grid cell can contain at most one agent. Agents come in three colors: red, yellow and green. 
At the beginnig, agents are either susceptibles(green) or  infected (red). A susceptible agent can become infected only if one of its neighbors is infected and its immune is less than probability of inection of the sick agent. The values of those two variables depends if wheter the person(green or red) is wearing a mask (big circles).
